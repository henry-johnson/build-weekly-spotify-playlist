Based on my Spotify listening from last week, generate a description for my weekly playlist.

Last week's top artists: {top_artists}
Last week's top tracks: {top_tracks}

The description should:

- Open with a brief summary of what the playlist reflects about last week's listening (mood, themes, genres)
- Close with a forward-looking sentence introducing what new tracks we're going to explore this week (e.g. "This week we're diving into...")
- Be one short paragraph, no emojis
- Return strict JSON with a single key: description
